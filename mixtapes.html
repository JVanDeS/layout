			<article><img id="mixtapes" src="http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/mbsAAOSwU-pXuiP2/$_35.JPG"><h1>Mixtapes</h1><p>At the age of 13, Logic met Solomon Taylor, who would soon become his mentor. Logic first became interested in rap and hip hop after watching themovie Kill Bill: Volume 1, directed by Quentin Tarantino, that same year. The film's score was completed by RZA, a member of the rap group Wu-Tang Clan. Following this, Logic began listening to the group, and soon expressed a deep affection for hip hop. Logic bought The Roots album Do You Want More?!!!??!, later that year, which prompted Taylor to bring Logic a large number of CD's containing instrumental beats, for him to write lyrics over.In 2009, Logic performed under the sobriquet "Psychological" with Logic describing the name as "one name that really stuck [with me]. I just loved this word because it was about the mind and I knew that's what I wanted my music to consist of; something that really challenges the mind." He released an unofficial mixtape titled Psychological â€“ Logic: The Mixtape under his original stage name. The mixtape allowed Logic to serve as the opening act for artists like Pitbull, EPMD, Method Man, Redman, and Ludacris at various shows all over Maryland. Soon after, he shortened the "Psychological" moniker to "Logic."</p></article>
