			<article><img id="tits" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ea/TheIncredibleTrueStory.jpg"><h1>T.I.T.S.</h1><p>On September 8, Logic released the trailer for his upcoming sophomore album, announcing that the album will be released in the fall of 2015 and is considered a "motion picture sci-fi epic," due to the story told throughout the album. The story, which takes places 100 years into the future, begins with Earth being uninhabitable due to severe human intervention. The primary characters begin traveling to a new planet called "Paradise," and as they travel, they play The Incredible True Story. It features Logic, Steven Blum (as Thomas), Kevin Randolph (as Kai), and Anna Elyse Palchikoff (as Thalia) as main characters, and the cast took part in a panel discussion to promote and talk about the album at New York Comic Con.</p></article>
